            This website was made to demonstrate my capabilities in working with the 2 most popular 
            front-end languages HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript. Its main purpose is that stated previously, but also serves
            as a way to showcase the photos I take in my spare time with my Canon EOS 2000D DLSR camera equipped with a Canon EFS 18-55mm focal length
            and f/4.0 max aperture.
